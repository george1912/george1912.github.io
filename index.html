        <div class="section">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is George Ulloa, and I am a former student in the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (ABSN) program at the University at Buffalo (UB). I created this website to share my personal experience and insights about my time at UB, specifically within the School of Nursing.</p>
    <p>From the excitement of embarking on my nursing career to the challenges I faced during my academic journey, I encountered a range of experiences that both inspired and tested me. My intention in sharing this story is not merely to recount my own journey, but to highlight certain systematic issues within the program that might resonate with others in similar situations.</p>
    <p>The reason behind this site goes beyond my own narrative. It serves as an open letter to those who are invested in the educational system, urging a fair and equitable environment that nurtures talents, recognizes hard work, and values diversity. By bringing my story to light, I hope to contribute to a broader conversation about academic fairness and integrity, with the ultimate goal of fostering positive change in our educational institutions.</p>
    <p>Through this platform, you will find my detailed account of events, supporting documents, and reflections on my journey at UB. I invite you to explore and engage with the content, and hope that it will spark dialogue, understanding, and, hopefully, transformation.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated Issues</h2>
            <p>
                The University at Buffalo School of Nursing's ABSN program's unfair dismissal led me to address significant issues within the program. The concerns I raised were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academic Concerns:</strong> Lack of accommodations, unrealistic workloads, teaching inconsistencies, and overall course failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral and Social Concerns:</strong> Inaction against harassment, alienation by staff, and unfair dismissals that impact mainily students of color.</li>
                <li><strong>Broader Implications:</strong> Contributing to the nursing shortage, causing personal and financial damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I believe in the value of nursing education and took an oath to maintain and elevate the standard of my profession. It is my hope that these issues can be acknowledged, addressed, and resolved to provide a fair and equitable nursing program for future students.
